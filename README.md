Read Tydex
==========

This utility reads in Tydex files into a Python object. Currently, it reads well enough to get the data we want 
from CALSPAN (Tire testing facility, Buffalo, NY) tests, but doesn't read every aspect of the Tydex spec (contributions 
welcome!). It is intended to be a starting point for analyzing tire data in Python. 

Requirements
------------
Python 3.7+ (I like dataclasses)
numpy
